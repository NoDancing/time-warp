## Project Context

Time Warp is a new iteration of an earlier personal project exploring chronological discovery of live music footage. This version is being developed from the ground up to reflect current skills, tooling, and architectural judgment, rather than to extend or maintain the original codebase. The goal is to produce a clean, well-documented implementation that demonstrates present-day design and engineering ability.
