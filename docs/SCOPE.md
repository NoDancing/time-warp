# Scope Definition

## In Scope (MVP)

- Manual submission of YouTube links
- Manual entry of performance dates
- Chronological browsing by date
- Shared, read-only discovery
- Persistent archive of contributed clips

## Explicitly Out of Scope

- Automated ingestion or scraping
- Recommendation systems or ranking
- User-to-user interaction (comments, likes)
- Artist, venue, or genre modeling
- Non-YouTube media sources

## Future Considerations (Non-Commitments)

- Automated validation or enrichment
- Additional browsing dimensions
- Moderation tooling
- Authentication and user accounts
